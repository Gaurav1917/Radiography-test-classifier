## Dataset:
  ### Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

## VGG19 Model: 
### https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/vgg19/VGG19

## Explanation about the project:

        The dataset has two parts(Train,Test).The training dataset has two classes (Lungs Disease,Normal), 
        the total images in training dataset is 16204. 
        *Training Data(images): 
        Normal - 8203, Lung Disease - 7063  
        *Test Data(images): 
        Normal - 1795, Lung Disease - 1695

The model is made by using CNN(convolutional neural network). As we donâ€™t have a large dataset so ,either you can generate image from ImageDataGenerator or use transfer learning ,here we used technique Transfer learning(VGG19 model) . The training accuracy we got from the model is 99.552% and test accuracy is 99.537%.

For deployment we used a gradio interface: https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface 
 ,also we used huggingface for deployment.
